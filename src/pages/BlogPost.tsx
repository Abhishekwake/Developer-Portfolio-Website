      "In this article, we'll explore the key steps to master prompt engineering quickly and easily.",
      "First, be clear and specific. Give AI precise instructions and context, like explaining technical concepts in simple language for beginners.",
      "Next, provide examples. Show the AI the style or format you want, so it can mimic your tone and structure accurately.",
      "Then, ask for step-by-step explanations. For complex topics, instruct AI to break down answers in a structured, easy-to-follow manner.",
      "Use role-playing for more accuracy. Assign AI a role, like senior engineer or mentor, to get expert-level guidance tailored to your audience.",
      "Finally, iterate and experiment. Tweak prompts for tone, length, and context to refine outputs and achieve better results every time."

      "First, Notion is an all-in-one workspace. You can manage your notes, to-do lists, projects, and even build dashboards without switching between different apps.",
      "Next, it lets you create your own system. Whether you’re a student, developer, or creator, you can design pages and templates that fit your workflow perfectly.",
      "Then, it helps you stay consistent. With Notion’s templates, reminders, and linked databases, you can track your habits, goals, and progress easily.",
      "Use it to build your second brain. Store your ideas, bookmarks, notes, and plans in a structured way so you never lose important thoughts again.",
      "Finally, start small and grow. Begin with a simple daily planner or task list, and as you get comfortable, expand into full systems for productivity, learning, or creativity."

      "First, set up n8n locally or on cloud and create a new workflow.",
      "Add an HTTP Request node to fetch your inventory data from a Google Sheet, database, or API endpoint.",
      "Next, connect an OpenAI node. Send the fetched inventory data as input and prompt OpenAI to create a summary like ‘Summarize today’s inventory status and highlight low-stock items.’",
      "Then, add an Email node. Use the OpenAI summary output as the email body and send it to your team or manager automatically.",
      "Finally, schedule the workflow to run daily. You’ll get AI-generated inventory summaries in your inbox — saving time and improving efficiency."
