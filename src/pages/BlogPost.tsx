      "First, start with foundations. Define your color palette, typography scale, spacing system, and elevation tokens. These are the atoms of your design language.",
      "Next, build component libraries. Create reusable UI components that implement your design tokens. Document their usage, variations, and best practices.",
      "Finally, establish governance. Create guidelines for how the design system evolves, who can contribute, and how changes are reviewed and approved.",
